##Visualizing Team Building Exercises

There's a series team building exercises to play with a group of people I was taught recently at my IBM Design internship. The concept is the entire group stands randomly within a room, and each player randomly selects two other players. Then everyone tries to follow a predetermined geometric rule. The fun part is that no one knows who everyone elses partner is. The ones we played with were:

1. Make an equilateral triangle with yourself and your two partners.
2. Keep one partner (your protector) between yourself and the other partner (your enemy).
3. Keep yourself in a line between your two partners.

I was curious what a final solution for each of these games might look like if they were carried out to infinity. So I coded the first example up in HTML. The gh-page for this repo ([ahadik.github.com/swarm](ahadik.github.com/swarm)) offers a live demo. The characteristics are interesting.

I'll be releasing the other two examples and hopefully some others in the near future.
